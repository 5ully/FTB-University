#FTB University

Issues with the modpack as a whole should go in the [Issues page](https://github.com/FTBTeam/FTB-University/issues).

Translators can submit Pull Requests [here](https://github.com/FTBTeam/FTB-University/pulls).

To translate the quests, make a new lang file in the format of your language (Spanish would be `es_es.lang`, for instance), copy the contents of en_us.lang, and translate it to language. Lang files are in `/resources/ftbuniversity/lang/`
